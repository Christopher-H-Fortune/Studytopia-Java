From there, You can create your own account to experience the current features implemented. You can use an account set up for testing purposes with the email and password below. However, you can't change the account password as it requires you to have access to the account email.
 
### Features ###
 
* If you login using the test account or creating an account, there is a public flashcard test that I created for you to try out. You can find it by opening the Navigation Drawer -> Public Flashcards -> Computer Science.

### Hardware Considerations ###
 
* Currently, Study Group is set to run at a minimum SDK Version 24 and a compile SDK Version 30.
 
### List of Known Bugs ###
 
* If you tap on the Study Group in the Navigation Drawer while you are not currently part of a Study Group, it will appear that you are in one. I need to create the UI to alert the user that they are not part of a Study Group and could either create or join one. 
 
* Topic of the Day is static and doesn't change daily yet, subsequently, the archived topics aren't added to either.
